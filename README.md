What is the edge? In general, edge devices are small, lightweight, devices on which a computer vision application can be deployed and run. Many edge devices today even have a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), or Visual Processing Unit (VPU), which enable usage of a greater range of models and application complexity. In the context of this article, an edge device is a device such as a Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson devices like the Jetson Nano or TX2, or various Internet of Things (Iot) devices, which are edge devices that have some capability to sense or assess, and possibly interact with, the environment in which they are used.

Deploying a production-quality computer vision application on the edge comes with its own set of challenges. With cloud computing you can scale instances when computation demand ramps up, however with edge devices, you are limited to the power of the individual device. Additionally, with edge deployment you may not have access to device status without integrating additional packages.
